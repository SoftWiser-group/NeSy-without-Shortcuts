# Program induction experiments
These experiments were inspired by the paper *Programming with a Differentiable Forth Interpreter* by Riedet et al.  [(paper)](https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Tim_Rocktaeschel/publication/303448644_Programming_with_a_Differentiable_Forth_Interpreter/links/57482a5708ae14040e2a4429/Programming-with-a-Differentiable-Forth-Interpreter.pdf) There are three different experiments:

* Learning to add
```bash
python Add/add.py
```
* Learning to sort
```bash
python Sort/sort.py
```
* Solving Word Algebra Problems (WAPs)
```bash
python WAP/wap.py
```

For an accurate comparison to the original paper, we converted their data to our format. Their data is available on the [d4 repository](https://github.com/uclmr/d4).
